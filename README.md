# Authorization-Optimization
## Physical Therapy Insurance Problems

This function adresses and streamlines physical therapists workflow in the company I work for. Recently an insurance company who we are in network
with has hired a third party company to manage their insurance authorizations. Typically these companies authorize physical therapy by
total number of visits. However, this new company has been authorizing visits by procedure codes. This function allows therapists to 
know how many visits patients will be authorized for, and what procedure codes they can bill to insurance company. 

There are three options of code combinations that allow for maximum number of visits for each patient, while maximizing reinbursement
for the company.
